This is a project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app)

## Gatineau Dev

The project is related to the City of Gatineau, originally created this personal project as I noticed that the cities assessment search was about 15+ years outdated, not only with styling, but also the address entry was multiple fields rather than utilizing a more modern location search service. It was also only available in French.

The assessment is also accessible through the main gatineau website if you have registered for an account, however even then, when viewed it will display the data on this outdated website.

While the current assessment functionality is "good enough" and most likely the developers have better things to focus on as it works, I decided to try and improve it for fun.
